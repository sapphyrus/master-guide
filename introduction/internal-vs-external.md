# Internal vs External

External cheats work by reading and writing game memory from a second process. This restricts them to a certain set of features but advanced things, such as HvH features, are simply not possible. They are usually separate windows and can be slower. Almost always used only for legit. You could go blatant with it, but definitely not spin.

Internal cheats work by injecting the whole cheat into the CS:GO process. This gives them access to access and modify everything in the game and lets them write much more efficient code, leading to better performance. Most big pay2cheat are internal, due to their much better efficiency. All HvH cheats are internal since HvH requires constant accurate timing and external is very delayed compared to internal.

## Pros and Cons:

#### Internals:

Pros: Internals are more efficient, can HvH, and are usually better. there is MUCH documentation on internals on github, unknowncheats, and mpgh. 
Cons: C++ is difficult to learn from zero coding experience. \(at least personally! -2772\)

#### Externals:

Pros: Can use more techniques against detection \(low ring for example\), easy to write for basic features compared to c++ \(again, personally -2772\) 
Cons: much less efficient, can be laggy if not optimized

What ISN'T different between the 2: detection is not easier or harder on internal or external. They are about the individual cheat.
